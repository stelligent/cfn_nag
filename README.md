# Background

The cfn-nag tool looks for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure.
Roughly speaking, it will look for:

* IAM rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
* Security group rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
* Access logs that aren't enabled
* Encryption that isn't enabled
* Password literals

For more background on the tool, please see:

[Finding Security Problems Early in the Development Process of a CloudFormation Template with "cfn-nag"](https://stelligent.com/2016/04/07/finding-security-problems-early-in-the-development-process-of-a-cloudformation-template-with-cfn-nag/)

# Installation

## Gem Install
Presuming Ruby >= 2.5.x is installed, installation is just a matter of:

```bash
gem install cfn-nag
```

## Brew Install
On MacOS or Linux you can alternatively install with brew:

```bash
brew install ruby brew-gem
brew gem install cfn-nag
```

# Pipeline

To run `cfn_nag` as an action in CodePipeline, you can deploy via the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:923120264911:applications~cfn-nag-pipeline).

# Usage

Pretty simple to execute:

```bash
cfn_nag_scan --input-path <path to cloudformation json>
```

The path can be a directory or a particular template.  If it is a directory, all `.json,` `.template`, `.yml` and `.yaml` files will be processed, including recursing into subdirectories.

The default output format is free-form text, but json output can be selected with the `--output-format json` flag.

Optionally, a `--debug` flag will dump information about the internals of rule loading.

Run with `--help` for a full listing of supported switches.

To see a list of all the rules cfn-nag currently supports, there is a command-line utility that will dump them to stdout:

```bash
cfn_nag_rules
```

## Results

* The results are dumped to stdout
* A failing violation will return a non-zero exit code.
* A warning will return a zero/success exit code.
* A fatal violation stops analysis (per file) because the template is malformed in some severe way

## Running in Docker

A Dockerfile is provided for convenience. It is published on DockerHub as `stelligent/cfn_nag`.

<https://hub.docker.com/r/stelligent/cfn_nag>

You can also build it locally.

```bash
docker build -t cfn_nag .
```

You can mount a local directory containing templates into the Docker container and then call cfn_nag in the container. This example uses the test templates used in unit testing cfn_nag:

```bash
$ docker run -v `pwd`/spec/test_templates:/templates -t cfn_nag /templates/json/efs/filesystem_with_encryption.json
{
  "failure_count": 0,
  "violations": [

  ]
}
$ docker run -v `pwd`/spec/test_templates:/templates -t cfn_nag /templates/json/efs/filesystem_with_no_encryption.json
{
  "failure_count": 1,
  "violations": [
    {
      "id": "F27",
      "type": "FAIL",
      "message": "EFS FileSystem should have encryption enabled",
      "logical_resource_ids": [
        "filesystem"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Results Filtering

### Profiles

cfn-nag supports the notion of a "profile" which is effectively a whitelist of rules to apply.  The profile is a text file
that must contain a rule identifier per line.  When specified via the `--profile-path` command line argument,
cfn-nag will ONLY return violations from those particular rules.

The motivation behind creating a "profile" is that different developers might care about different rules.  For example, an
"infrastructure_developer" might care about IAM rules, while an "app_developer" might not even be able to create
IAM resources and therefore not care about those rules.

Here is an example profile:

```
F1
F2
F27
W3
W5
```

### Global Blacklist

The blacklist is basically the opposite of the profile: it's a list of rules to NEVER apply.  When specified via the
`--blacklist-path` command line argument, cfn-nag will NEVER return violations from those particular rules specified
in the file.

In case a rule is specified in both, the blacklist will take priority over the profile, and the rule will not be applieed.

The format is as follows.  The only two salient fields are `RulesToSuppress` and the `id` per item.  The `reason` won't
be interpreted by cfn-nag, but it is recommended to justify and document why the rule should never be applied.

```yaml
---
RulesToSuppress:
- id: W3
  reason: W3 is something we never care about at enterprise X
```

### Per-Resource Rule Suppression

In the event that there is a rule that you want to suppress, a `cfn_nag` `Metadata` key can be added to the affected resource to tell cfn_nag to not raise a failure or warning for that rule.

For example, if you are setting up a public-facing ELB that's open to inbound connections from the internet with resources like the following:

`public_alb.yaml`

```yaml
# Partial template
PublicAlbSecurityGroup:
  Properties:
    GroupDescription: 'Security group for a public Application Load Balancer'
    VpcId:
      Ref: vpc
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
PublicAlbSecurityGroupHttpIngress:
  Properties:
    CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
    FromPort: 80
    GroupId:
      Ref: PublicAlbSecurityGroup
    IpProtocol: tcp
    ToPort: 80
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
```

cfn_nag will raise warnings like the following:

```bash
$ cfn_nag_scan -i public_alb.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
public_alb.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| WARN W9
|
| Resources: ["PublicAlbSecurityGroup"]
|
| Security Groups found with ingress cidr that is not /32
------------------------------------------------------------
| WARN W2
|
| Resources: ["PublicAlbSecurityGroup"]
|
| Security Groups found with cidr open to world on ingress.  This should never be true on instance.  Permissible on ELB

Failures count: 0
Warnings count: 2
```

By adding the metadata, these warnings can be suppressed:

`public_alb_with_suppression.yaml`

```yaml
# Partial template
PublicAlbSecurityGroup:
  Properties:
    GroupDescription: 'Security group for a public Application Load Balancer'
    VpcId:
      Ref: vpc
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
  Metadata:
    cfn_nag:
      rules_to_suppress:
        - id: W9
          reason: "This is a public facing ELB and ingress from the internet should be permitted."
        - id: W2
          reason: "This is a public facing ELB and ingress from the internet should be permitted."
PublicAlbSecurityGroupHttpIngress:
  Properties:
    CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
    FromPort: 80
    GroupId:
      Ref: PublicAlbSecurityGroup
    IpProtocol: tcp
    ToPort: 80
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
```

```bash
$ cfn_nag_scan -i public_alb_with_suppression.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
public_alb_with_supression.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
Failures count: 0
Warnings count: 0
```

# Setting Template Parameter Values

CloudFormation Template Parameters can present a problem for static analysis as the values are specified at the point
of deployment.  In other words, the values aren't available when the static analysis is done - static analysis
can only look at the "code" that is in front of it.  Therefore a security group ingress rule of 0.0.0.0/0 won't
be flagged if the cidr is parameterized and the 0.0.0.0/0 is passed in at deploy time.

To allow for checking parameter values, a user can specify the parameter values in a JSON file passed on the command line
to both `cfn_nag` and `cfn_nag_scan` with the `--parameter-values-path=<filename/uri>` flag.

The format of the JSON is a single key, "Parameters", whose value is a dictionary with each key/value pair mapping to
the Parameters:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "Cidr": "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}
```

This will provide "0.0.0.0/0" to the following Parameter:

```yaml
Parameters:
  Cidr:
    Type: String
```

_BEWARE_ that if there are extra parameters in the JSON, they are quietly ignored (to allow `cfn_nag_scan` to apply
the same JSON across all the templates).

If the JSON is malformed or doesn't meet the above specification, then parsing will fail with a FATAL violation.

# Controlling the Behavior of Conditions

Up until version 0.4.66 of cfn_nag, the underlying model did not do any processing of Fn::If within a template.  This meant that if a property had a conditional value, it was up to the rule to parse the Fn::If.  Given that an Fn::If could appear just about anywhere, it created a whack-a-mole situation for rule developers.  At best, the rule logic could ignore values that were Hash presuming the value wasn't a Hash in the first place.

In order to address this issue, the default behavior for cfn_nag is now to substitute Fn::If with the true outcome.  This means by default that rules will not inspect the false outcomes for security violations.

In addition to substituting Fn::If at the property value level, the same behavior is applied to Fn::If at the top-level of Properties.  For example:

```yaml
Resource1:
  Type: Foo
  Properties: !If
    - IsNone
    - Description: Up
    - Description: DOwn
```

Will look the same as:

```yaml
Resource1:
  Type: Foo
  Properties:
    Description: Up
```

To provide some control over this behavior, a user can specify the condition values in a JSON file passed on the command line
to both `cfn_nag` and `cfn_nag_scan` with the `--condition-values-path=<filename/uri>` flag.

The format of the JSON is a a dictionary with each key/value pair mapping to the Conditions:

```json
{
  "Condition1": true,
  "Condition2": false
}
```

# Distribution of Custom Rules

The release of 0.5.x includes some major changes in how custom rules (can) be distributed and loaded.  Before this release,
there were two places where rules were loaded from: the `lib/cfn-nag/custom_rules` directory within the core cfn_nag gem,
and the custom-rule-directory specified on the command line.

There are two use cases that forced a redesign of how/where custom rules are loaded.  The rule loading mechanism has been
generalized such that custom rule repositories can be used to discover rules.

1. A bunch of "rule files" sitting around on a filesystem isn't great from a traditional software development perspective.
There is no version or traceability on these files, so 0.5.x introduces the notion of a "cfn_nag rule gem".  A developer
can develop custom rules as part of a separate gem, version it and install it... and those rules are referenced from cfn_nag
as long as the gem metadata includes `cfn_nag_rules => true`.  For a gem named like "cfn-nag-hipaa-rules", any \*.rb under
lib/cfn-nag-hipaa-rules will be loaded.  Any custom rules should derive from CfnNag::BaseRule in cfn-nag/base_rule (*not* cfn-nag/custom-rules/base).  If the rule must derive from something else, defining a method `cfn_nag_rule?` that returns true will also cause it to be loaded as a rule.

2. When cfn_nag is running in an AWS Lambda - there isn't really a filesystem (besides /tmp) in the traditional sense.
Therefore, only core rules are usable from the Lambda.  To support custom rules, cfn_nag supports discovering rules
from an S3 bucket instead of the filesystem.

Everything you've likely seen about how to develop custom rules in Ruby still holds true.

To discover rules from an S3 bucket, create a file `s3.yml` with this content:

```yaml
---
repo_class_name: S3BucketBasedRuleRepo
repo_arguments:
  s3_bucket_name: cfn-nag-rules-my-enterprise
  prefix: /rules
```

To apply *Rule.rb files in the bucket cfn-nag-rules-my-enterprise with the prefix /rules (e.g. /rules/MyNewRule.rb),
specify this file on the command line to cfn_nag as such:

```yaml
cat my_cfn_template.yml | cfn_nag --rule-repository s3.yml
```

If rules are in more than one bucket, then create multiple s3*.yml files and specify them in the `--rule-repository` argument.

If the ambient AWS credentials have permission to access the bucket `cfn-nag-rules-enterprise` then it will find all rules
like `/rules/*Rule.rb`. If a particular aws_profile should be used, add it as a key under `repo_arguments`, e.g
`aws_profile: my_aws_profile`

Beyond the filesystem, gem installs and S3 - the new architecture theoretically supports developing other "rule repositories"
to load rules from DynamoDb, relational databases, or other web services.

# Development

## New Rules

To author new rules for your own use and/or community contribution, see [Custom Rule Development](custom_rule_development.md) for details.

A screencast demonstrating soup-to-nuts TDD custom rule development is available here:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRZct0naFd4&t=1601s>

## Specs

To run the specs, you need to ensure you have Docker installed and cfn_nag dependencies installed via
```
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

Then, to run all of the specs, just run `rake test:all`.

To run the end-to-end tests, run `rake test:e2e`. The script will bundle all gems in the Gemfile, build and install the cfn_nag gem locally, install spec dependencies, and then executes tests tagged with 'end_to_end'. It will also pull down sample templates provided by Amazon and run cfn_nag_scan against them, to see if any known-good templates cause exceptions within cfn-nag.

## Local Install
To install the current git branch locally:
```
bundle install
scripts/deploy_local.sh
```

## VS Code Remote Development
There is a complete remote development environment created and setup with all the tools and settings pre-configured for ease in rule development and creation. You can enable this by using the VS Code Remote development functionality.
