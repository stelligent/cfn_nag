# Background

The cfn-nag tool looks for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure.
Roughly speaking it will look for:

* IAM rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
* Security group rules that are too permissive (wildcards)
* Access logs that aren't enabled
* Encryption that isn't enabled
* Password literals

For more background on the tool, please see:

[Finding Security Problems Early in the Development Process of a CloudFormation Template with "cfn-nag"](https://stelligent.com/2016/04/07/finding-security-problems-early-in-the-development-process-of-a-cloudformation-template-with-cfn-nag/)

# Installation

## Gem Install 
Presuming Ruby >= 2.5.x is installed, installation is just a matter of `

```bash
gem install cfn-nag
```

## Brew Install
On MacOS or Linux you can alternatively install with brew

```bash
brew install ruby brew-gem
brew gem install cfn-nag
```

# Pipeline

To run `cfn_nag` as an action in CodePipeline, you can deploy via the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:923120264911:applications~cfn-nag-pipeline).

# Usage

Pretty simple to execute:

```bash
cfn_nag_scan --input-path <path to cloudformation json>
```

The path can be a directory or a particular template.  If it is a directory, all \*.json, \*.template, \*.yml and \*.yaml files underneath
there recursively will be processed.

The default output format is free-form text, but json output can be selected with the `--output-format json` flag.

Optionally, a `--debug` flag will dump information about the internals of rule loading.

Run with `--help` for a full listing of supported switches.

To see a list of all the rules the cfn-nag currently supports, there is a command-line utility that will dump them to stdout:

```bash
cfn_nag_rules
```

## Results

* The results are dumped to stdout
* A failing violation will return a non-zero exit code.
* A warning will return a zero/success exit code.
* A fatal violation stops analysis (per file) because the template is malformed in some severe way

## Docker Container

A Dockerfile is provided for convenience. It is published on DockerHub as `stelligent/cfn_nag`.

<https://hub.docker.com/r/stelligent/cfn_nag>

You can also build it locally.

```bash
docker build -t cfn_nag .
```

You can setup a File Share in Docker to share a folder that contains templates. After the share is setup you can call cfn_nag in the container. This example uses the test templates used in unit testing cfn_nag.

```bash
$ docker run -v `pwd`/spec/test_templates:/templates -t cfn_nag /templates/json/efs/filesystem_with_encryption.json
{
  "failure_count": 0,
  "violations": [

  ]
}
$ docker run -v `pwd`/spec/test_templates:/templates -t cfn_nag /templates/json/efs/filesystem_with_no_encryption.json
{
  "failure_count": 1,
  "violations": [
    {
      "id": "F27",
      "type": "FAIL",
      "message": "EFS FileSystem should have encryption enabled",
      "logical_resource_ids": [
        "filesystem"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Results Filtering

### Profiles

cfn-nag supports the notion of a "profile" which is effectively a whitelist of rules to apply.  The profile is a text file
that that must contain a rule identifier per line.  When specified via the `--profile-path` command line argument,
cfn-nag will ONLY return violations from those particular rules.

The reasoning behind a "profile" is that different developer might care about different rules.  For example, an
"infrastructure_developer" might care about IAM rules, while an "app_developer" might not even be able to create
IAM resources and therefore not care about those rules.

Here is an example profile:

```
F1
F2
F27
W3
W5
```

### Global Blacklist

The blacklist is basically the opposite of the profile: it's a list of rules to NEVER apply.  When specified via the
`--blacklist-path` command line argument, cfn-nag will NEVER return violations from those particular rules specified
in the file.

The blacklist will trump the profile in case a rule is specified in both.

The format follows.  The only two salient fields are `RulesToSuppres` and the `id` per item.  The `reason` won't
be interpreted by cfn-nag, but it is recommended to justify why the rule should never be applied.

```yaml
---
RulesToSuppress:
- id: W3
  reason: W3 is something we never care about at enterprise X
```

### Per-Resource Rule Suppression

In the event that there is a rule that you want to suppress, a `cfn_nag` `Metadata` key can be added to the affected resource to tell cfn_nag to not raise a failure or warning for that rule.

For example, if you are setting up a public-facing ELB that's open to inbound connections from the internet with resources like the following:

`public_alb.yaml`

```yaml
# Partial template
PublicAlbSecurityGroup:
  Properties:
    GroupDescription: 'Security group for a public Application Load Balancer'
    VpcId:
      Ref: vpc
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
PublicAlbSecurityGroupHttpIngress:
  Properties:
    CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
    FromPort: 80
    GroupId:
      Ref: PublicAlbSecurityGroup
    IpProtocol: tcp
    ToPort: 80
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
```

cfn_nag will raise warnings like the following:

```bash
$ cfn_nag_scan -i public_alb.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
public_alb.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| WARN W9
|
| Resources: ["PublicAlbSecurityGroup"]
|
| Security Groups found with ingress cidr that is not /32
------------------------------------------------------------
| WARN W2
|
| Resources: ["PublicAlbSecurityGroup"]
|
| Security Groups found with cidr open to world on ingress.  This should never be true on instance.  Permissible on ELB

Failures count: 0
Warnings count: 2
```

By adding the metadata, these warnings can be suppressed:

`public_alb_with_suppression.yaml`

```yaml
# Partial template
PublicAlbSecurityGroup:
  Properties:
    GroupDescription: 'Security group for a public Application Load Balancer'
    VpcId:
      Ref: vpc
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
  Metadata:
    cfn_nag:
      rules_to_suppress:
        - id: W9
          reason: "This is a public facing ELB and ingress from the internet should be permitted."
        - id: W2
          reason: "This is a public facing ELB and ingress from the internet should be permitted."
PublicAlbSecurityGroupHttpIngress:
  Properties:
    CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
    FromPort: 80
    GroupId:
      Ref: PublicAlbSecurityGroup
    IpProtocol: tcp
    ToPort: 80
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
```

```bash
$ cfn_nag_scan -i public_alb_with_suppression.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
public_alb_with_supression.yaml
------------------------------------------------------------
Failures count: 0
Warnings count: 0
```

# Setting Template Parameter Values

CloudFormation Template Parameters can present a problem for static analysis as the values are specified at the point
of deployment.  In other words, the values aren't available when the static analysis is done - static analysis
can only look at the "code" that is in front of it.  Therefore a security group ingress rule of 0.0.0.0/0 won't
be flagged if the cidr is parameterized and the 0.0.0.0/0 is passed in at deploy time.

To allow for checking parameter values, a user can specify the parameter values in a JSON file passed on the command line
to both `cfn_nag` and `cfn_nag_scan` with the `--parameter-values-path=<filename/uri>` flag.

The format of the JSON is a single key "Parameters" whose value is a dictionary with each key/value pair mapping to
the Parameters like such:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "Cidr": "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}
```

will fill in "0.0.0.0/0" to the following Parameter:

```yaml
Parameters:
  Cidr:
    Type: String
```

_BEWARE_ that if there are extra parameters in the JSON they are quietly ignored (to allow `cfn_nag_scan` to apply
the same JSON across all the templates)

If the JSON is malformed or doesn't meet the above specification, then parsing will fail with FATAL violation.

# Controlling the Behavior of Conditions

Up until version 0.4.66 of cfn_nag, the underlying model did not do any processing of Fn::If within a template.  This meant that if a property had a conditional value, it was up to the rule to parse the Fn::If.  Given that an Fn::If could appear just about anywhere, it created a whack-a-mole situation for rule developers.  At best, the rule logic could ignore values that were Hash presuming the value wasn't a Hash in the first place.  

In order to address this issue, the default behavior for cfn_nag is now to substitute Fn::If with the true outcome.  This means by default that rules will not inspect the false outcomes for security violations.  

In addition to substituting Fn::If at the property value level, the same behavior is applied to Fn::If at the top-level of Properties.  For example:

```yaml
Resource1:
  Type: Foo
  Properties: !If
    - IsNone
    - Description: Up
    - Description: DOwn
```

Will look the same as:

```yaml
Resource1:
  Type: Foo
  Properties:
    Description: Up
```

To provide some control over this behavior, a user can specify the condition values in a JSON file passed on the command line
to both `cfn_nag` and `cfn_nag_scan` with the `--condition-values-path=<filename/uri>` flag.

The format of the JSON is a a dictionary with each key/value pair mapping to the Conditions like such:

```json
{
  "Condition1": true,
  "Condition2": false
}
```

# Development

## New Rules

To author new rules for your own use and/or community contribution, see [Custom Rule Development](custom_rule_development.md) for details.

A screencast demonstrating soup to nuts TDD custom rule development is available here:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRZct0naFd4&t=1601s>

## Specs

To run the specs, you need to ensure you have Docker installed and cfn_nag dependencies installed via
```
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

Then, to run all of the specs, just run `rake test:all`.

To run the end-to-end tests, run `rake test:e2e`. The script will bundle all gems in the Gemfile, build and install the cfn_nag gem locally, install spec dependencies, and then executes tests tagged with 'end_to_end'. It will also pull down sample templates provided by Amazon and run cfn_nag_scan against them, to see if any known-good templates cause exceptions within cfn-nag.

## Local Install
To install the current git branch locally:
```
bundle install
scripts/deploy_local.sh
```
